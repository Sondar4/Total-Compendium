                    <p><strong>Tactics</strong> is everything related to the individual, or combined, use 
                        of the <em>units</em> of the army during the battle. It's very important to know how to
                        use the different types of units to get the most out of them and instead of losing them stupidly.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses, but units of the same class (e.g. light cavalry),
                        tend to have a similar behaviour. Therefore, this section is divided into the main types of units
                        that appear in the games.
                    </p>

                    <p>There is one very important rule that applies to all units: don't start battles that you can't win. If you think
                        that one of your units is going to lose against one of the enemy, don't send it to the fight.
                        As Sun Tzu said:
                    </p>
    
                    <div class='quote'>
                        <p class='quote'>The troops you send against the enemy must be like stones thrown against eggs.
                        </p>
                    </div>
    
                    <p>The only exception to this rule is doing it to win time; even then it isn't something I would recommend
                        unless you are in a desperate situation.</p>
    
                    <p>Back to this site, there are also sections with tactics to achieve a specific objective, such as the section on
                        anticavalry tactics. These tactics are more advanced and tend to combine
                        different types of units.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Finally, in each time of history different units dominate the battlefield,
                        and what in one game on a very effective tactic, on other it's not working anymore. 
                        This is due to changes in the composition of armies in dsitinct epochs (and in the game's mechanics). 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>I hope you find the sections useful!
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Note: I don't include monsters because I haven't played Warhammer enough.
