                <p><strong>Strategy</strong> is the approach of the use of the <em>army</em> as a hole.
                    Once we know how the units work we can design armies in such a way that all of them act
                    together to achieve one common goal: to defeat the enemy.
                    If we are already superior in numbers and quality, there's no merit at all on winning 
                    a battle. It's in equality or disadvantaged positions when the <strong>design
                    of the army</strong> and the <strong>planning of the battle</strong> gain in importance. 
                </p>

                <p>The <strong>planning of the battle</strong> can only be done once we've seen the enemy army and the 
                    battlefield, and it should be in harmony with the <strong>design of the army</strong>. Moreover, once
                    the battle has started, we will have only some seconds to sketch its course, so it has to be something simple and
                    effective. Complicated strategies often fail because they are difficult to implement; they require too much unit
                    management.
                </p>

                <p>The strategies in this section belong to the realm of <strong>army design</strong>. Furthermore, they are of
                    general purpose. If we know the faction/s we are facing we can and should design the army having this in mind,
                    in order to exploit their weaker points.
                </p>

                <p>Finally, there are two general rules when designing the army and planning the battle.
                    First, you should always try to have the maximum number of available units, i.e., all the unit slots used.
                    If we have less units than our foe we could be easily outflanked and that's something we want to avoid (I think 
                    in Warhammer games this isn't so critical).
                    Second, don't leave gaps in your lines. This also includes not leaving gaps between your lines and your allies' ones 
                    on multiplayer games. Gaps can be used by the enemies to kill your missile units and rearcharge you,
                    and that's something you want to avoid.
                </p>

                <p><em>Note: when I talk in this page of gaps, I mean big gaps, that enemy cavalry can use to outflank. The gaps that
                    I talk about on missile infantry sections are small gaps that can't be used by enemy cavalry for this purpose.
                </em></p>
