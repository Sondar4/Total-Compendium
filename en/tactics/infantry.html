                <p>Infantry is the backbone of most armies, a bone that if broken leaves us vulnerable.
                    A simple way to ponderate whether an infantry unit will lose in melee against another
                    is to compare their <strong>costs</strong>: expensive units beat cheap ones. When the price of units doesn't differ much,
                    another factors come into play; exploiting them is often key to winning battles against other players.
                </p>

                <p>Beyond the obvious, there are some more details to keep in mind to use infantry well:</p>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Units have different masses depending on their armor and training, but this isn't very important
                            when fighting other infantry. Instead, the <strong>mass</strong> becomes more relevant against horsemen, elephants,
                            chariots, (monsters)... The more massive a unit is, the better it will stand the charge, and less 
                            damage will suffer.
                        </li>
                        <li>The <strong>charge bonus</strong> is a determining point for the outcome of an infantry combat.
                            It is why barbarians can crush Roman legions.
                            Keep it in mind, take advantage of the charge bonus of your wildest units with 
                            <a href='/en/tactics/cavalry#clean-charges'>clean charges</a> and protect yourself
                            from the charges of the strongest units of your foe.
                        </li>
                        <li>There are two types of damage, basic damage and penetration damage. Penetration damage ignores enemy's armor.
                            It's that simple. <em>Choose your weapons depending on your enemy</em>. If you face heavily armored enemies,
                            grab the axe. If you face naked euphoric Celts, a sword will suit you better.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Numbers matter</strong>. A unit that has enemies in front and to the sides will suffer more casualties because it
                            will receive hits from many directions and there will be men (or women) who will have to fight against several
                            enemies at once.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Swords</h3>

                <picture class='capture'>

                    <img src='/captures/swordsmen-light.jpg' class='logo' alt='Kushite warriors'/>
                </picture>

                <p>The base of most armies. Use them against enemy infantry, but beware of their cavalry. Swordsmen with javelins,
                    like Roman legionnaires with their pilum, can do a lot of damage to horses when throwing them.
                </p>

                <p>In general, a unit of swordsmen with a cost <em>x</em> will defeat a unit with lances or halberds
                    of the same cost.
                </p>

                <p>Some infantry units with swords have shield formation; it is convenient to activate it if you foresee an enemy
                    cavalry charge. If, otherwise, it is an infantry charge that is coming, it is best to charge ourselves
                    as well.
                </p>

                    <img src='/captures/axemen-light.jpg' class='logo' alt='Saxons with axes'/>
                </picture>

                <p>Axe bands are similar to swordsmen units, but with greater penetration damage and a better charge
                    bonus, although they tend to have less armor. Very useful against the enemy's most armored units,
                    but remember to always be the one who charges.

                </picture>

                <p>Spearmen: the base of many armies. They are the most flexible infantry units, thanks to their
                    ability to kill cavalry and their big shields (almost all spearmen have shield) that protect them from arrows.
                    Try to have spearmen units close to your swordsmen or axemen to protect them from enemy cavalry.
                    In addition, they defend the flanks very well. Their weak point: they will almost always
                    lose against the enemy's swords (unless your spearmen are significantly superior to rival swords).
                </p>

                <p>Use them as a first line against armies that stand out in cavalry and missile.
                    Against armies with good melee infantry, use them as support units.

                </picture>

                <p>A kind of midpoint between swords and spears. They are better in melee than spearmen,
                    but they have no hands left to carry a shield, so arrows are their worst enemy.
                    That's why they work best in armies that are powerful in ranged combat, which can finish
                    off enemy archers before they can shoot the halberdiers.

                </picture>

                <p>Alexander's anvil. I wonder if antiquity pikemen where as powerful as they are in games.
                    In any case, they have a big weakness: their terrible maneuverability; a player
                    with some experience will play with them like spanish 'toreros' play with bulls. 
                </p>

                <p>Very useful against AI, not very useful against other players. They are still playable, but you have to know 
                    to make the enemy go to them. 
                    A <em>strategy</em> in which I use them consists in investing many resources in one flank
                    to ensure victory in that flank and then sorround the enemy to attack from the rear. 
                    The way to prevent the enemy from sending more troops to defend the flank with few resources
                    (we have invested a lot in the flank) is to cover the center with cheap pikes that advance slowly.

                <p>I don't mean that this is the best way to use pikemen,
                    it's just an example in which I take advantage of their strengths.

                <p>Great charge bonus (unless you're a dwarf) and damage but weak defense. It's not worth it to have a lot of 
                    them in the army, they're more adequate to flank and attack enemy units already in combat. On the other hand,
                    well used provide a huge tactic advantage, because they get rid of enemies <strong>fast</strong>.
                    Two or three units of this type charging against units inferior to them can open in a short time a
                    <strong>breach</strong> in the enemy lines. If you want to test it, incorporate a pair of these units in a line of
                    armoured swordsmen that can stand a long melee. My favorite strategy with Carthage is similar to This.

                <h3>Blocking savage's charges</h3>

                <p>If we play with armies like the Roman and face barbarians (e.g. Boii, Lusitanians) we have the
                    problem that our units have little charge bonus and theirs a lot. This causes that our units will suffer
                    too many casualties in the first shock, even if we countercharge. The solution is to hinder the
                    enemy's charge.
                </p>

                <p>A way to block these charges is to put some cheap skirmishers in front of your main line. When the enemy
                    is very near, charge with your infantry, but do it in a way that the first shock is received by some fleeing
                    skirmishers, but not too many of them: they are cheap but you don't wanna lose 'em all.
                </p>

                <p>Other option is to use cavalry to charge enemies first and break their lines, and then incorporate
                    infantry while retreating cavalry. This is a difficult maneuver, but in some situations very helpful.
                    Anyway, anything you come up with that can hinder the enemy's charge can work;
                    it's said that necessity sharpens ingenuity.
                </p>

                </picture>

                <p>Finally, in Three Kingdoms, elite sentinels bring the ability to block charges to melee infantry
                    under their command. Although I don't quite understand how it works
                    against cavalry, I've seen that it reduces the damage they receive from the charge but
                    they still receive a lot of damage.

                <h3>Relieving fatigued soldiers</h3>

                <p>A very important point, especially in siege battles or settlements.
                    Exhausted units fight worse than those who aren't, so if a unit is
                    very tired and we have fresh units in the rear, it's a good idea to exchange them.
                    There's an important point to avoid casualties in the procedure: first join the fresh
                    unit into combat and then retreat the tired one. In this order.
