                    <p>We can classify cavalry following two criteria: the mass (or armour) and the speciality.</p>
                    <p>According to their <strong>mass</strong> we have: very light, light, medium, heavy and superheavy.</p>
                    <p>According to their <strong>speciality</strong> we have: melee, shock and missile.</p>

                    <p>Apart of this classification, almost all cavalry have the same point in common: their stronger point
                        is the charge bonus. So to get the most of them we have to make whenever we can <em>clean charges</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>And don't forget to use your cavalry to chase enemies fleeing at the end of the battle!
                        They're free casualties in the enemy's army.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Usage tips</h4>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make clean charges. In other words, ensure there are no friendly or enemy units between
                            your cavalry and its target when charging.</li>
                        <li>Never, ever, make a frontal charge against a spearmen unit. You can charge them from 
                            other directions, but withdraw the unit quick or they'll suffer unnecessary casualties.
                        </li>
                        <li>Get the most of the terrain. Downhill charges are much more destructive.
                            On the other hand, uphill charges lose a large part of their power.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Melee cavalry</h3>

                    <picture class='capture'>
                        <source media='(min-width: 961px)'
                            srcset='/captures/melee-cavalry.jpg'/>

                    </picture>

                    <p>Melee cavalry is usually distinguished by the weapon they use. In this way, we can distinguish
                        between two types of melee cavalry: melee cavalry with <strong>spears</strong>
                        and melee cavalry with <strong>swords/axes/maces</strong>.</p>

                    <p>
                        Melee cavalry with <strong>spears</strong> shines for its <em>flexibility</em>.
                        It's the easiest to use, and as it usually has shield, stands well against enemy shots.
                        Furthermore, they have a strong charge. For this reason, you can use it for fighting enemy 
                        cavalry, for charging infantry or pursuing archers. 
                        As examples we have the greek citizen cavalry or the japanse yari cavalry.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The other melee cavalry is more suited for <em>fighting infantry</em>.
                        They usually use swords and perform well in a prolonged combat with infantry,
                        but we must still take advantage of its charging power to maximize its performance.
                        An example would be the katana cavalry of Shogun 2.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Let's sum it up. In order to fight against the enemy cavalry the spear is more suitable;
                        in order to fight against the enemy infantry the sword is more suitable. However spear cavalry
                        will perform well in both cases, while sword cavalry will only perform well in the second one.

                    <h3>Shock cavalry</h3>
                   
                    <picture class='capture'>
                        <source media='(min-width: 961px)'
                            srcset='/captures/shock-cavalry.jpg'/>
                        <img src='/captures/shock-cavalry-light.jpg'  class='logo' alt='Qiang cavalry'/>
                    </picture>

                    <p>As it's name indicates, it's main purpose is to charge the enemy. They can be distinguished by their
                        long spears. Well used, shock cavalry can give you the battle.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>To maximize the damage they do, once
                        the shock has taken place, don't let them fighting. Unless you foresee that the enemy will flee
                        soon, wait a few seconds and withdraw it. Then charge again.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>They're usually more vulnerable to shots than standard cavalry (they usually don't have shields)
                        Have <strong>special care</strong> with weapons with high armor piercing damage,
                        as <strong>crossbows and javelins</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>As a general rule, a medium shock cavalry unit will win against a medium infantry unit if they 
                        make a clean charge. For that reason, light cavalry is useful for charging against missile units
                        (they are usually light) and superheavy cavalry, well, they can destroy everything.
                        Receiving a charge from a superheavy shock cavalry unit is similar to being hit by a train.
                    </p>

                    <div class='image-container'>
                        <img src='/images/train.svg' class='picture' alt='Train'/>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>
                        If the charge is downhill or the unit has no shield (or you are playing Three Kingdoms)
                        you can add one to the mass of the infantry unit receiving the charge.
                        It means, a medium shock cavalry unit charging downhill can deal heavy damage
                        to a heavy infantry unit.

                    <h3>Missile cavalry</h3>

                    <p>Being brief, the cavalry of projectiles has a function: to annoy.
                        Being less brief it has two: to entertain the enemy's large units
                        and to sorround him to shoot him from behind.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Entertain</h4>

                    <p>Flank the enemy and start shooting at his heavy cavalry or elephants. If the enemy is clever
                        he'll ignore the shots and push the elephants away. If he isn't, he will send his cavalry to chase
                        yours and you won't let him catch'em. Take advantage of it and drag the best of the enemy cavalry to
                        the confines of the map. The Romans did something similar to
                        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_III_the_Great'>Antiochus III</a>,
                        who was commanding one of the cavalry wings of his army. While he was obfuscated with the Roman wing his
                        army was being annihilated.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Sorround</h4>

                    <p>The other use of missile cavalry is to surround the enemy and empty the ammunition bags on his back.
                        And if you run out of ammo... Charge!
                    </p>

                    <picture class='capture'>

                    </picture>

                    <p>Eastern kingdoms and empires have used camels in combat throughout history. We have
                        examples as old as the camel catafracts of the Partian empire to as modern as the beduins who
                        who shoot from their camels.
                    </p>

                    <p>The main advantage camels have is that they are bigger than horses and their smell scares them.
                        On the other hand, they are slower, so their loads are less powerful, which means you have to be
                        careful with frontal charges from enemy cavalry. In addition, a unit frightens enemy horses the same as
                        two (at least in games), so its most appropriate use is to support one's own cavalry when
                        fighting against the enemy's one.
                    </p>

                    <p>Summing up, combine camels and shock cavalry to have a flank that can easily surpass the enemy's cavalry.

                    <h3>Clean charges and formations</h3>

                    <p><em>To do as much damage as possible with a charge, it must be clean.</em>. And as a picture is often 
                        worth a thousand words, there you have a picture of a clean charge.

                    </picture>

                    <p>The Huns are going to be devastated because the charging power of the sassanid catafracts
                        is far superior. Melee cavalry must be careful when charging against shock cavalry because
                        it can take many casualties on impact. If you can, let your shock cavalry to receive (and give) the
                        first hit and then send melee cavalry to the combat.
                    </p>

                    </picture>

                    <p>All cavalry charges should be like that. Why? Because it maximizes
                        the number of enemy units hit.
                        So we don't have to use cavalry formations? Not usually.
                    </p>

                    <h4>When to use cavalry formations?</h4>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Wedge</strong> formation. It's useful when we're not following the rule of the masses, 
                        because it increases the damage done by the cahrge of our unit and it will be easier for us to withdraw
                        it (with the wedge formation our unit mixes less with the enemy's),
                        because if we don't take it back, we're probably gonna get our asses kicked. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Diamond</strong> formation. It's useful when charging against enemy cavalry
                        or when we charge against a tangle of cavalry killing each other. It gives two advantages,
                        increases the mass of the unit and its ability to divide the enemy unit 
                        (a divided enemy unit is weaker) and increases our unit's defensive ability.
