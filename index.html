                <p>Although everyone attributes the authorship of this phrase to Sun Tzu, wikiquote tells us that
                        it doesn't appear in any translation of his book, so it would be more correct:</p>

                <h3>Difference between tactics and strategy</h3>
                <p>If you are unfamiliar with the concepts of tactics and strategy, the above phrases may seem meaningless.
                    If we look up the definition of strategy in a dictionary we get the following:</p>
                <p><em> A detailed plan for achieving success in situations such as war, politics, business, industry,
                    or sport, or the skill of planning for such situations.</em></p>
                <p>And for tactics</p>
                <p><em>The organization and use of soldiers and equipment in war.</em></p>
                <p>They aren't very enlightening, but they give a little idea of what strategy and tactics
                    represent at game level. 
                    <strong>Tactics</strong> is everything related to the individual, or combined, use 
                    of the <em>units</em> of the army during the battle. <strong>Strategy</strong> is
                    the approach prior (or at least it should be) to the battle of the use of the
                    <em>army</em> as a whole.</p>
                <p>Hence my emphasis on tactics in my version of the famous phrase. If you don't know
                    that you should never front charge with cavalry a spears unit, or that crossbows
                    and guns are specially useful against armoured enemies, both belonging to the field of 
                    tactics, you're hardly going to win a battle.
                    Once you've mastered tactics, you can enter into the much more creative realm of strategy, and then
                    to enjoy overflowing the enemy.

                <h3>About this site</h3>
                <p>I've been playing Total War games for many years. Since I discovered Medieval II, I've played
                    to all the games (but Britannia (updated, I've already played it)), and I've devoted more hours to them than I'd like to admit... Specially,
                    to Rome II, in which I spent a while playing exclusively online battles. I learned a lot
                    at that time of other players by suffering it in my flesh (well, in my soldiers' flesh).
                </p>
                <p>How does this mix with creating a website? I wanted to learn HTML5 and CSS and, apart from knowledge,
                    it takes practice, a lot. So as I didn't know any website with a compendium of tactics and strategies
                    for Total War games,
                    I thought it was a good idea to create it myself, with my knowledge. I hope that all players, both new
                    and old, will be able to take something of this site.
                    Regards.
                </p>
