# Total Compendium

A web guide for Total War games with both the basics and more advanced topics. My approach is to differentiate between unit tactics and army strategies; for those not familiar with those concepts:

*Tactics is everything related to the individual, or combined, use of the units of the army during the battle. Strategy is the approach prior (or at least it should be) to the battle of the use of the army as a whole.*

Both in Spanish and English.
